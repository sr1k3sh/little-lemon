# The Booking App

This Booking App was created as the final capstone project of the **Meta Front-End Developer Certification**.

**Preview**: Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant that blends traditional recipes with a modern twist. Our goal is to provide our customers with a unique dining experience that will take them on a culinary journey through the Mediterranean.

# Front-end Architecture

There were several considerations for the frontend architecture.

1. **Folder Structure** - How files are orgranized.

---

## Folder Structure

```s
├── .next
└── app
└── node_modules
└── pages
  └── book-table
  └── thank-you
└── public
└── src
  └── components
    └── ui
  └── context
  └── lib
```

---

# Future Considerations

- The app can be internationalized.
- The app can have a CMS to fetch data from.
- authentication can be added.
